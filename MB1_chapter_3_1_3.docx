Four measuring campaigns were conducted in 2011
during which most sites were investigated repeatedly (2 – 6 May, 22 – 27 May,
25 – 28 July, 8 – 14 September, i.e. in calendar weeks 18, 21, 30 and 36). The
measurements were arranged within a two-stage nested design, which was chosen
for later upscaling purposes. Four grassland plots were distributed over the
study area to cover the climatic gradients best. Each has an area of 750 x 750
m2. Within one plot, Elementary Sampling Units (ESUs) are distributed, each
situated within an individual land use segment, i.e. meadow. Special attention
was paid to a sufficient distance (20 m) from field boundaries to avoid border
areas (McCoy 2005). The ESUs constitute an area of 20m x 20 m, covering 3 x 3
RapidEye pixels. During the campaigns, measurements were conducted at in total
17, 20, 25 and 33 ESUs during the weeks 18, 21, 30 and 36, respectively. On
every ESU, 20 measurement points were arranged on two diagonal transects,
constituting a cross sampling scheme and keeping about 3.1 m distance between
each sample point.

 

LAI was measured indirectly in the field with
the LICOR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA) (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska USA).
Its optical technique is based on the measurement of visible light (320 nm –
490 nm) transmittance through the canopy by comparing measured light
intensities above (A) and below (B) the canopy (Jonckheere et al. 2004; Weiss
et al. 2004). Within each ESU 20 B measurements were conducted, while the A
measurements were repeated only 4 times just before the first and each fifth B
measurement. From that comparison, the probability of seeing the sky when
looking up through the canopy in different directions is derived, which is
based on the two canopy structure parameters LAI and the mean foliage tilt
angle (MTA) (LI-COR 2009). 

During the measurements, a 270° view cap was
used on the sensor head to mask out the operator. Measurements were as well
conducted during overcast conditions as under direct sunlight, in which case
the sensors head and the canopy under investigation were shaded. Measurements,
for which the light intensity below the canopy exceeded the above measured
value due to changing light conditions or operator errors, were excluded from
the calculations. While the LAI value of the ESU relies in 75% of the cases on
all 20 A and B measurement pairs, it is based in 23% of the cases on 19 – 16
measurement pairs due to these exclusions. Only in 2 % of the cases less than
16 measurement pairs were achieved. The average LAI was therefore considered to
be representative for the respective ESU. 

 

At 14 ESUs the LAI was additionally determined
by destructive sampling. These direct measurements are used as a reference for
the different derivation algorithms implemented in the LICOR software.At each
sampling point an area of 1000 cm2 was chosen randomly within the ESU. The
complete biomass was harvested in this sample. The samples where immediately
packed into plastic bags and stored within a cooler until its storage in a
refrigerator. On the same days, the harvested leaves were laid out on a white
background in such a way that no overlap existed between adjacent leaves,
flattened by a glass pane and photographed from nadir with a digital camera. On
some dates, a scanner was available which was used to gain a picture of the
flattened plant elements instead. In a last step these images were
automatically segmented in foliage and background pixels. The number of pixels
falling in the foliage class was related to the total area of the plane, and
summed up in case the samples could not fit within one photograph. In calendar
week 36, the workload was reduced by taking three subsets of the whole biomass
of one sample, which were laid out and photographed in order to determine the
LAI of the subset, dried, and weighted. That LAI was then scaled to the total
harvested, dried, and weighted biomass by using the samples mean specific leaf
area (SLA)(Landsberg and Gower 1997; Jonckheere et al. 2004). For the LAI
determination, no distinction was made between green and senescent plant
material, an assumption that is however in line with the LAI-2000 measurements.
